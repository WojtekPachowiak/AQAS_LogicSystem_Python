# AQAS logic system implementation in Python
Here's the article: [AQAS_CPL.pdf](https://github.com/WojtekPachowiak/AQAS_LogicSystem_Python/files/6662003/AQAS_CPL.pdf)


aqas_main_WITH_PRINTS.py is less elegant but has print() functions all over the place for debugging. Also it's not as up to date as the file without prints.

# I don't feel like writing documentation at the moment ;0 
I tried to document most of the steps using comments in the aqas_main.py file. Reach to me in case of uncertainty.
