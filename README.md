# AQAS logic system implementation in Python


aqas_main_WITH_PRINTS.py is less elegant but has print() functions all over the place for debugging. It might get outdated easily.

# I don't feel like writing documentation at the moment ;0 
I tried to document most of the steps using comments in the aqas_main.py file. Reach to me in case of uncertainty.
